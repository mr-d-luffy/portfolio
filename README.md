</div>

---

## Executive Summary

A production-grade, highly interactive portfolio application engineered to showcase technical expertise across Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Modern Software Engineering. Moving beyond traditional static documentation, this platform delivers an immersive, high-performance user experience powered by WebGL physics simulations, real-time data integrations, and an autonomous AI chatbot assistant.

---

## System Architecture & Technologies

The repository is built on a modern, decoupled architecture designed for maximal performance, scalability, and maintainability.

### Core Framework
- **Next.js 16 (App Router):** Leverages server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and advanced caching mechanisms for optimal content delivery.
- **React 19 & TypeScript:** Enforces strict type safety and modern reactive paradigms across 50+ custom UI components.

### 3D Graphics & Physics Simulation
- **Three.js & React Three Fiber (R3F):** Powers the core WebGL rendering engine.
- **Rapier Physics:** Integrates real-time, deterministic physics simulations (e.g., interactive 3D Lanyard and structural models).
- **Custom GLSL Shaders:** Utilized for bespoke background elements, including the Hyperspeed and warp effects.

### UI/UX Choreography
- **Framer Motion & GSAP:** Drives complex, timeline-based choreographies, micro-interactions, and fluid page transitions.
- **Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UI:** Provides a scalable, utility-first design system utilizing robust Radix UI accessibility primitives.
- **Lenis:** Implements smooth, premium scrolling dynamics.

### System Integrations & APIs
- **Dual-LLM AI Chatbot Architecture:** Integrates Groq (LLaMA 3.1) as the primary provider with an automatic failover to Google Gemini (1.5 Flash), utilizing retrieval-augmented generation context mapped directly from `portfolio.ts`.
- **GraphQL & REST Pipelines:** Consumes GitHub GraphQL for repository statistics and WakaTime API for real-time code telemetry.
- **Next-Intl:** Provides a complete bilingual experience (EN/ID) driven by client-side browser header detection.

## Key Features

### 1. Interactive 3D Environments
Implements hardware-accelerated 3D models using `@react-three/drei` and `@react-three/fiber`. Features include a physics-simulated identification badge that responds to cursor velocity and window constraints in real time.

### 2. Autonomous Portfolio Chatbot
An intelligent conversational agent deployed via the `/api/chat` route. The system builds a dynamic context window from the static `portfolio.ts` database and processes natural language queries using a redundant Dual-LLM infrastructure.

### 3. Real-Time Telemetry
Dashboards across the platform retrieve and display real-time engineering metrics, utilizing authenticated GraphQL requests to GitHub (activity heatmaps, language breakdown) and WakaTime (coding hours, IDE preferences).

### 4. Interactive PDF Document Viewer
A custom-built document rendering engine utilizing `react-pdf`, allowing users to zoom, rotate, search, and download the resume natively within the browser application without relying on external plugins.

### 5. Performance Diagnostics
The application implements a `usePerformance` hook to evaluate client hardware capabilities in real time, automatically disabling intensive WebGL shaders and complex GSAP animations on low-power or mobile devices to preserve battery life and maintain stable framerates.
